// ---- TCP API ----
// -----------------

/**
 * The TCP API is more complicated than the UDP API; instead of just sending packets to a destination, we
 * maintain an open session with a client and are guaranteed that packets are received in the same order that
 * they are sent
 *
 * TCP socket flow goes something like..
 *
 * client: populate address info -> make socket -> connect socket -> send and recv -> free socket
 *
 * server: populate local addr -> make socket -> bind locally -> listen for connections --
 *           --> receive or send from the established connection -> free socket
 *
 * The main notable difference from udp programatically is that you can recv and send on the same socket
 * once a connection iE established. Because it's bidirectional and both client/server can do this, you 
 * need to have a well established order of operations (protocol) for sending and receiving so you don't
 * end up in socket spinlock
